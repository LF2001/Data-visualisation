# Data-visualisation

Data is beautiful.
Here are some examples of the data visualisations I created for recent projects. 
These plots were created using Python (matplotlib), Matlab, and R.

The following is a deliberately brief summary of the data presented in each plot (the goal here is to demonstrate effective data visualisation rather than delving into the specific details of the data presented):

Figure S1.tif - Line plots of time-series neural activity recorded from different locations on the head (event-related potentials). The heatmaps are a bird's-eye-view of the same activity at specific time points.

Figure1.tif - On the left a polar histogram showing the frequency that people (total sample was 23) identify a specific hue as being either red, orange, yellow, lime, green, teal, blue, or purple. On the right are the mean of these hue selections (plus 95% confidence intervals) plotted in the perceptually uniform colour space CIELUV.

Figure2.tif - Along the top are best-fitting ellipses applied to hue settings (as in Figure1.tif above) and the magnitude of neural activity elicited by seeing those hues. Along the bottom left are the mean values for the neural activity with error bars and the bottom right are mean time-series neural activity (right) elicited by those hues.

Panel_figure_color_selections.tif - Scatter plots depicting the location of people's best examples of red, yellow, green, and blue on the top row and orange, lime, teal, and purple on the bottom row in a perceptually uniform colour space (CIELUV).

Sigmoid_half_function_v3.tif - Different half-sigmoid functions applied theoretically to explain why people perceive colours differently depending on whether the colour is a good example of a colour category prototype (e.g., a good green colour) compared to a boundary colour (e.g., a blueish green).
